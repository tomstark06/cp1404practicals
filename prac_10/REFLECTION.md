# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate was usually fairly accurate, within 5/10 minutes. Except for prac 7, it was way off for the large task haha.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It stayed fairly similar in terms of accuracy, maybe improved more where I was able to estimate within 5 minutes instead
of 10.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt how useful it is for planning out my time. And it has helped me estimate how long the assessment will take to
complete.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

There are always issues with your code, or things that can be improved. No matter how good I felt about the prac there
was usually something.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I have learned to develop more of an eye for catching bugs, DRY errors, style guide or naming convention mistakes etc.
This has proved helpful when doing my assessment.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Good Review 1 - Prac 5](https://github.com/Calsgit/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

I think this was my best review in terms of tone. I think I was able to be encouraging while also pointing out mistakes
and areas to improve in the code.

### Good Code Review 2

[Good Review 2 - Prac 7](https://github.com/perryvillacampa/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

I think this was my best review in terms of spotting improvements that could be made. I was able to identify a number of
unnecessary lines of code, and also naming conventions that were broken. I also was able to see a way that code could be
simplified to become easier to read.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think the one practical I would change is practical 7, the final exercise. I know that it is supposed to be too long,
and it should require lots of work. However, I feel that the amount of time I spent on it was similar to a small
assessment, but it was worth barely any marks.
Other than that, I always love a programming subject with Lindsay, because they are always the most organised
and clear subjects I take during any term of university, including the practicals.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I was able to learn really well from each practical. After I made lost some marks in one practical, I was able
to learn from it and get full marks in the following weeks. I think this skill also has helped me with my assessment
work.
