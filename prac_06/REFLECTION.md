# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have begun committing with more purposeful messages, as well as committing in smaller chunks.
I also am working on improving my process by coding more incrementally instead of doing it all at once, 
I have found it very helpful to do this for more complex tasks.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

As mentioned above, still working on coding more incrementally to reduce errors and increase understanding.
Part of this is that I would like to do micro tests more often, especially now with more complex concepts like
classes.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am keeping up with the content and understanding it well. I will also continue to use the patterns and processes 
on the patterns and style guides pages on GitHub.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to make sure that I am reading the whole task, as quite a number of times I have had to return to my
code and make a small change that could have been caught earlier if I had read through intentionally and properly
the first time.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think maybe some more handwritten coding from the beginning of the subject would be helpful for preparing
for the exam, because it is much different than coding with an IDE.
