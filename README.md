# Thomas Stark CP1404 Practicals

This is where all of my practical work for CP1404 is stored.

## About the Repo

Included in this repo is all the practical work from CP1404, as well as many code 
reviews from myself and other students. There have been many lessons learned from doing this subject and 
these pracs. Here are the three main lessons I have learnt about *clean code*
- All clean code starts and ends with Ctrl+Alt+L (auto formatting)
- Naming conventions have purpose. At the beginning it doesn't seem like it, but once classes, dictionaries, and constants are all mixed in together, you notice the difference and can understand code much better.
- Constantly checking for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) errors helps maintain simple to understand and simple to fix code. Making it super easy to keep it clean.

## About Me

My name is Thomas Stark, and I am currently a mid-year first year student studying education at JCU.
There are lots of things that I love, but here is an ordered list to make it simple:

1. Jesus Christ
2. My Family and my Girlfriend
3. Sport (particularly the Warriors (NBA) and Cricket Australia)
